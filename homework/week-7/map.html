					Percentage of female graduates per country
				</h2>
				<p>
					This graph shows for every country the percentage of graduates that are female. The values are devided in 3 groups: a = 0 - 50%, b = 50 - 60%, c = 60 - 100%. These percentages are an average of all fields of study and all the different levels of tertiary education (bachelor, master and docteral). This shows that most countries show a division of graduates between genders close to 50-50.

					Percentage of female graduates per level and field
				</h2>
				<p>
					When clicking on a country you can see the percentages of female graduates per level (bachelor, master or doctoral) and field of study. This shows that in some cases the percentage of female graduates differs between the different levels of education. In these cases the percentage of female graduates is often higher in the bachelor level compared to masters and doctoral.
